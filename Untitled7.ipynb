    "The first line of Python code can’t have an indentation, it will throw IndentationError.\n",

    "It is preferred to use whitespace than the tab character.\n",
    "The best practice is to use 4 whitespaces for the first indentation and then keep adding additional 4 whitespaces to increase the indentation.\n",

    "The proper use of indentation in a program provides many benefits, some of them are: \n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation is important to increase the readability of the code by clearly indicating the hierarchy (i.e. if statements belong to the same block or not).\n",
    "This avoids the need to use delimiters such as braces or brackets, which is mandatory in most programming languages like C, C++, Java, etc.\n",
    "Python indentation is consistent throughout the program, making it easier to debug.\n",
    "In most programming languages, indentation makes the structure of the code proper. Python uses it for grouping, making the code automatically beautiful.\n",
